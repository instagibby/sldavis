# Angular Team Example Assignment



This assignment was given as a group project, though since I spent the week before learning angular to do a programming challenge I was exempt from the assignment and was to just present my [Task List Challenge](https://github.com/instagibby/TaskListChallenge "TaskListChallenge") to the class. I ended up doing the assignment myself as I was curious how to overcome a few obstacles, and this is what I ended up with!


# Instructions


Use Angular to dynamically alter the available options in the drop down.  
For example: Once a user has selected an option as 1. Best Time automatically remove it from the rest of the drop downs.  
Do this as each option is chosen. 



The Reset button should refresh the drop downs to their original values.



Demonstrate your application and explain your code to the class.
