  <h1>Research 2D vs 3D Transformations</h1>

  <P> X and Y aren't quite like the normal x and y coordinates that we think of from math class. You start top left corner and its 0,0. Top to bottom, left to right, and make sure to use webkits for it to work in all browsers possible!</p>

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Sort of the same as above, you need to make sure you are using the webkits to ensure browser capatability, and also to remember that your 0,0 point is the top left of the screen.</p>

  <p>Basically the same as above. You need to remember to use the webkits to ensure browser support, also to remember that the 3d transforms come with their own set of individual properties.</p>

  <p>Transforms are the complete and total center of the element. For 3D transforms to work, the elements need a perspective from which to transform. Think vanishing point. This is called by either: transform: perspective(value); or perspective: value;</p>
