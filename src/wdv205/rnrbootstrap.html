  <p> Bootstrap is a framework that allows you to use preset rules and styling to help make a website.
  </p>
  <p> A CSS framework is a group of tools that help you build a website better, faster, or both.
  </p>
  <p> Bootstrap is referred to as a framework because it doesn't produce content for you but provides a frame *hehe* for you to put your content in if you so choose.
  </p>
  <p> Advantages are clean and responsive sites, lot of power in most of them. Disadvantage would be sometimes they are very heavy (take a lot of bandwidth).
  </p>
  <P>1) Responsive design - you use CSS Grid to make your webpage work on all sizes of devices
  </p>
  <P>2) Image fluidity - using .img-fluid provides a very easy way to get all of your images to be responsive
  </p>
  <P>3) Forms - Building forms is super easy using the framework and you are able to use grid inside of the form for a great looking, responsive form.
  </p>
  <P>4) Navagation - Either hamburger menu or normal navbar it is easy to make your page look good and even breadcrumb  with just a few simple stylings.
  </p>
  <P>5) Image carosel / rotator - making images on your display is super easy to do and is very easily customizable for automation or clicking to change image.
