  <h1>Unit-4 Preprocessor</h1>

  <p>1) Preprocessors make it possible to use things like math, variables or mix-ins.</p>
  <p>2) CSS preprocessors let you do things that you are unable to normally do in CSS and makes for a much more streamlined work. You can duplicate the same effect multiple times and then you are able to change all of them seamlessly and quickly.</p>
  <p>3) Debugging is harder, which is a big time sink in some cases. Compilation will also slow down the speed of developement. You can also over engineer, for instance naming a variable a color, then changing that color, it can make things messy down the road as well as easier.</p>
  <p>4) Sass, STylus, LEss, PostCSS, cssnext</p>
  <p>5) So I found one after going through maybe 20 "web dev jobs" <a href="https://www.tesla.com/careers/job/web-developer-55494?source=Indeed">at tesla...</a> but that was it, mentions of CSS but no preprocessors. I assume they are maybe too new?</p>

  <h2> SASS / SCSS </h2>
  <p> the main difference between SASS and SCSS is that SASS uses different syntax than normal CSS where as SCSS lets you use your normal CSS and then when you need to do SASS it uses the same syntax but with a little SASS in there, so you can still write your normal non SASS code as CSS instead of trying to deal with writing it in SASS so it'll convert to what you want.</p>
