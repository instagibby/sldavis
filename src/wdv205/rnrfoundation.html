  <p>Zurb Foundation
  </p>
  <p> Zurb - it is opensource
  </p>
  <p> Adobe, Ebay, HP, Samsung, Amazon, EA, Pixar etc..
  </p>
  <p> the framework uses CSS Grid to format the page as well as comes with a wide range of tools you can use to make your webpage great.
  </p>
  <p>Advantages are that it is lighter weight than bootstrap, you only need to pull in what you are using as well as has SASS built in. Disadvantages is that sometimes if you need more than you originally downloaded you need to redo your foundation package download unless you downloaded everything
  </p>
  <p> Primary features include Forms, tons of different containers, with navigation you have a ton of options, sass mixins, and tons of pre-built (by the community) features & tools
