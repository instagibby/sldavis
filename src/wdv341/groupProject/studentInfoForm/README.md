# Team Project - Self Posting Form

## Instructions:

1) Update the form to be a PHP self posting form.

2) Implement PHP validations for each field.  The validation requirements for each field are listed on the page.  You do NOT need Javascript validations for this project.

3) Validate the input fields on the server using PHP. Use regular expressions and patterns for this whenever possible.  If there are any invalid fields display the appropriate error messages, apply a CSS style to the error fields. Put all form data back into the appropriate fields. Display to the user. 

4) Protect your form with one of the methods discussed in the class. 

5) When the form inputs are valid display a confirmation message to the page instead of the form.
