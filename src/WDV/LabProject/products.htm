      <h3>Landscaping & Gardens </h3>
        <p><font color=	#9ACD32>City Gardens & Landscaping</font> has tackled just about every kind of landscaping
          project you can imagine. If it involves the outdoors, we can design it. We also
          have the added benefit of carrying our own top quality plants and landscape
          supplies. Our full service Nursery and Garden Center allows YOU to select what
          goes into your project. We’re always happy to get your input before we begin.
