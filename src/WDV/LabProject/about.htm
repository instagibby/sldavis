      <h3> Our History </h3>
      <p> <font color=		#6B8E23>City Gardens & Landscaping</font> started business in 2005 by founder Mr. Joe
          Boxelder. We started from humble beginnings, running two landscaping crews,
          and operating a small retail nursery. As the City of Des Moines grew, so did we.

      <h3> Our Staff </h3>
      <p> Over the years, <font color= #6B8E23>City Gardens & Landscaping</font> has tripled both in size, and in
          products offered. Weâ€™ve been under the same name and <strong>ownership for over 10
          years</strong>. City Gardens & Landscaping now employees 30-40 employees, and
          carries the largest selection of plant materials in the area. We have strong ties to
          the local community, and have decades of landscape history and community
          service work here. </p>
