    <h1> Hope </h1>
      <img class="float" src="/WDV/Homework/Images/planet.png" title="Hope" alt="Hope"/>
      <h4> A whole new world awaits! This is a once in a life time opportunity to be able to live on another planet that can sustain life! </h4>

    <h2> A new planet to claim </h3>
      <p> Only you can choose to take on this expedition. You have to make the choice to come with us into this world of a new adventure, and only you then can see and find what awaits us on Hope. </p>

    <h2> Government on Hope </h2>
      <p> The government will consist of many layers, like our government on Earth does. It will not be a direct democracy but will be very close. We have to work closely with scientists as to get their imput on certain aspects and at that point we can make correct choices based off of that information. </p>

    <h2> Working </h2>
      <p> Each person who would like to participate in governing will be able to assist as long as they have proof of proper education and work credentials to prove they are a functioning member of society. Ultimately we don't wish to have people who have no idea what is going on to have any power on Hope. </p>

    <h2> Prized Resources </h2>
      <p> As we are not in the business to destroy this planet like we did to our once beloved planet Earth we will not be harvesting them. We will be strictly using solar and wind energy to power our lives. </p>
