        <h1>Plan the trip of a lifetime!</h1>
          <p>You will be able to choose from any three great locations! These are very flexible for when you leave and how long you want to stay, the longer the stay the less you pay!</p>
          <p> Depending on your location and time and the chosen destination we will provide a list of available activities and travel guides to take you through the stay.</p>
          <p> If it be a night on the town you wish for, or a night alone to make your way through the selected city don't let us stop you! At any point you are able to take your own route and do things that are not listed in the options. This trip is about you after all and having all the fun you could hope for! </p>
