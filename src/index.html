            <p class="lead">Hello I am Spencer Davis, 24, and from Iowa. I have many experiences with computers that all started with gaming when I was young. That love for games and the internet flourished into a desire to make my own sites and games. I got on the internet
              and learned a bit of Javascript and Python to then start making a game through the Unity Engine using C#. After that eye opening experience and the satisfaction it brought me I decided to change course from my Associates of Arts through
              DMACC to get myself a Web Developement Diploma (finishing Spring 2018) and to pursue a career with UI/UX and making video games in mind.</p>

            <p class='description'>This is a project I made for my lovely girlfriend Claire and her pet sitting business she runs. I made it using bootstrap for one of the final projects of my Advanced CSS class. I learned a lot about responsive design and getting images to size automatically using the img-fluid class. The main problem I had was the carousel for the images but managed to get it working! </p>

            <p class='description'>The Sweet Buffet was the third wordpress site I made in my wordpress class. It is a e-commerce site with fully functioning paypal and shopping. I learned a ton about setting up products, specials, coupons, making cross sales as well as how to custom CSS in wordpress.</p>

            <p class='description'>To The Limit was my second wordpress site. It was based around a fitness center that offered many different classes. The biggest thing I learned while making it was event calendars and how to micromanage the event list. There are so many ways to schedule and post events or make popups that notify visitors of new classes.</p>

            <p class='description'>This was my final project for my wordpress class as well as a team project. My partner Justin and myself worked together to put together a site for the INOA and their new program called What You Don't See. It had a range of requirements for backend admin roles and restricting usage of the site based on your login / role. It was very enlightening with the capabilities of wordpress and what can be made fairly quickly and easily to produce many options for administration.</p>

            <p class='description'>This is the first real project I put together and had the goal of making it look nice, while still following the guidelines for points. I learned a lot as well as have learned so much since then. I also added an animated advertisement (for my advanced CSS class) that slides into view and can be closed by an x or closes automatically after some time.</p>

            <p class='description'>I worked on this short project with Brady as a brief project. We were supposed to go out and find a theme to make a page out of that utilized the bootstrap framework. I learned about the power of bootstrap but still really had no idea how powerful frameworks could be or even how to use the framework by the time I was done with it. Because it was mostly pre-built we simply found the things we needed to change in the CSS and modified the CSS to how we wanted the page to look and just ran with it.</p>

      <h3 class="mainpara">A little bit about me</h3>
      <p>I'm 24 years old and learning how to build my own websites and program my own games. Currently I know how to use HTML, CSS, C#, Python and JavaScript. I have self taught myself quite a lot but also going to school so that I have a piece of paper
        to show jobs saying I'm capable. Or so that's the hope. One day I hope to be successful through an app or site that I make and maybe I can make it big and then do what I want when I feel like it, but until that day and I am done with college I
        will continue to do what I need to do to get by.</p>
      <h3 class="mainpara">Why I do what I do</h3>
      <p>I've grown up playing lots of video games in my free time. I regularly used the internet my entire childhood and because of the amount of time I have spent around computers and in general just using them it gave me the drive and desire to make my
        own. Often I will use a website for a product or restaurant to try and navigate through their information but I will be turned away by a slow moving, lackluster site. This is something I want to be able to help create so that not only will it
        function, but function well and effectively. That is my goal when I make sites.</p>
