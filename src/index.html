      <p>I'm 24 years old and learning how to build my own websites and program my own games. Currently I know how to use HTML, CSS, C#, Python and JavaScript. I have self taught myself quite a lot but also going to school so that I have a piece of paper
        to show jobs saying I'm capable. Or so that's the hope. One day I hope to be successful through an app or site that I make and maybe I can make it big and then do what I want when I feel like it, but until that day and I am done with college I
        will continue to do what I need to do to get by.</p>
      <h3 class="mainpara">Why I do what I do</h3>
      <p>I've grown up playing lots of video games in my free time. I regularly used the internet my entire childhood and because of the amount of time I have spent around computers and in general just using them it gave me the drive and desire to make my
        own. Often I will use a website for a product or restaurant to try and navigate through their information but I will be turned away by a slow moving, lackluster site. This is something I want to be able to help create so that not only will it
        function, but function well and effectively. That is my goal when I make sites.</p>
