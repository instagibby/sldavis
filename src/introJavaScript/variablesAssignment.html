	<hr />
	<p>1. Define four global variables called color1 through color4. Assign the variables a color.</p>
	<script>
		var color1 = "red";
		var color2 = "blue";
		var color3 = "green";
		var color4 = "yellow";
	</script>
	<p>2. Create a function called getColor( ). Create a local variable called color5.</p>
	<script>
		function getColor() {
			var color5 = window.prompt("Type a color");
		}
	</script>
	<p>3. In the getColor( ) use the prompt( ) to ask the user for a color. Store this value in the color5 variable. Use a button with an onclick event handler to activate this function.</p>

	<input type="button" value="Get Color" onclick="getColor();">

	<p>4. Create a function called displayColors( ). Use the alert( ) to display all the color variables and their associated value. Use a button with an onclick event handler to activate this function.</p>

	<script>
	function displayColors(){
		alert(color1);
		alert(color2);
		alert(color3);
		alert(color4);
		alert(color5);
	}
	// you are trying to access a local variable outside of the scope of the function it was declared in, if you had set color5 to be a global variable (outside of getColor) then it would let you save the prompt as the new variable, overwriting it into the new color that was typed into the prompt, thus letting it work.
	</script>

	<input type="button" value="display Colors" onclick="displayColors();">
	<p>5. In your comments address why color5 cannot be displayed by the displayColors( ) function. </p>
