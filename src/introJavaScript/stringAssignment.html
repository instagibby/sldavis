	<script>
	// #1 - makes variable named inName that is saved as a global variable with an empty string
		var inName = "";

	// #2 - this creates a function called getName that prompts the user to enter a name and then saves it as a variable inName, and on the next line alerts the name that was previously entered.
		function getName() {
			inName = window.prompt("Enter a Name");
			alert(inName);
		}

	// #3 creates a function called displayName that alerts the previously set value of inName (presumably a name) and then also alerts the length of the string that inName is set to.
		function displayName() {
			alert(inName);
			alert(inName.length);
		}

		// #4 saves two global variables that are strings, which are my normal and school email addresses.
		var emailAddress = "spencerdavis2012@gmail.com";
		var yourEmailAddress = "sldavis7@dmacc.edu";

		function getEmailName(x) {
			var begin = x.indexOf('@');
			var mailer = x.substr(0, begin);

			alert(mailer);
		}

	</script>
	<p>1. Define a global variable called inName. Assign it an initial value of &quot;&quot;.</p>

	<p>2. Create a function called getName( ). The function will use a prompt to ask the user to enter a name. Store the result in the inName variable. Use an event handler to activate this function.</p>

	<input type="button" value="Get Name" onclick="getName();">

	<p>3. Create a function called displayName( ). The function will use alert( ) to display the value stored in the inName variable. It will also display the number of characters in the inName variable. Use and event handler to activate this function.</p>

	<input type="button" value="Display Name" onclick="displayName();">

	<p>Define a global variable called emailAddress. Assign it an email address. Define a global variable called yourEmailAddress and assign it the value of your DMACC email address.</p>

	<p>Create a function called getEmailName( ). This function will accept one input parameter. When the function is called display only the name from the email address. For example if the user enters &quot;jLeenan@yahoo.com&quot; your function should display
		&quot;jLeenan&quot;. Use an event handler to activate this function.</p>


	<p>4. Use the getEmailName( ) function to process emailAddress.</p>

	<input type="button" value="Personal e-mail" onclick="getEmailName(emailAddress);">

	<p>5. Use the getEmailName( ) function to process yourEmailAddress.</p>

	<input type="button" value="School e-mail" onclick="getEmailName(yourEmailAddress);">

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
